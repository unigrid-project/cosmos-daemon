**Pax**, the consensus layer of Unigrid, is engineered using the cutting-edge Cosmos SDK and fortified by CometBFT. While `Hedgehog` stands as the core of our network, providing essential services like drive storage, compute, and application execution, Paxd serves a crucial, complementary role. It acts as the bridge to this core network, facilitating a seamless integration of the gridnodes that constitute the Unigrid network.

Paxd's function is vital in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of network transactions and interactions. It underpins the democratic consensus process that is foundational to our decentralized architecture. This strategic positioning of Paxd allows it to not only support the robust framework established by Hedgehog but also to enhance it by ensuring equitable and consistent participation of all network nodes.

The name `paxd`, inspired by the Latin word for peace, mirrors our aspiration for a network that is harmonious and stable, yet dynamic and inclusive. It reflects our dedication to creating a network environment that balances advanced technological capabilities with security and fairness. In the spirit of its namesake, Paxd brings order and tranquility to the network, ensuring that operations run smoothly and without disruption.

As the mediator between Hedgehog and the gridnodes, Paxd ensures that every component of the Unigrid network, from the core services to the peripheral nodes, operates in unison. It upholds the balance, making sure that every participant, big or small, has a voice in the consensus process. This reinforces the resilience and decentralization of the Unigrid network, maintaining it as a cohesive, equitable digital ecosystem.

In essence, Paxd is not just a consensus layer; it is the harmonizing force that binds the diverse elements of the Unigrid network into a single, efficient entity. It symbolizes our commitment to a decentralized future where technology is not just powerful and innovative but also equitable and smooth-running.

## System Requirements

This system spec has been tested by many users and validators and found
to be comfortable:

- Quad Core or larger AMD or Intel (amd64) CPU
  - ARM CPUs like the Apple M1 are not supported at this time.
- 64GB RAM (can use swap)
- 1TB NVMe Storage
- 100MBPS bidirectional internet connection

You can run Pax on lower-spec hardware, but you
may find that it is not highly performant or prone to crashing.
